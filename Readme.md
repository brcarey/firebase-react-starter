# Introduction

Firestarter is a solution template for building blockchain based web applications on top of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

The solutions consists of three packages:

* [web](/web): A React front-end written in TypeScript, configured with Redux, MaterialUI and Styled Components
* [functions](/functions): A GraphQL based Firebase Functions back-end written in TypeScript
* [chain](/chain): A truffle project written in TypeScript

All three packages are strongly typed, with even code-generated types for GraphQL schema and queries, along with generated types for the Solidity smart contracts.
